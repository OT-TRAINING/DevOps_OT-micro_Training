</div>

A loaded microservice applications for doing different kinds of POC. This is a sample Employee System which is designed to understand the microservices nature and behaviour.

## Purpose

The purpose of creating this application is to provide an individual, a holistic idea of microservices architecture, it's working, and its setup.

## Applications

These are few microservices which are getting used in this complete project.

|**Application Name**|**Default Port**|**Dependency**|**Language**|**Description**|
|--------------------|----------------|------------|--------------|---------------|
| [attendance](./attendance) | 8081 | MySQL | <img src="https://cdn.worldvectorlogo.com/logos/gopher.svg" height="32" width="32"> | Attendance is a microservice which is designed in Golang to manage employee's attendance information. |
| [employee](./employee) | 8083 | Elasticsearch | <img src="https://cdn.worldvectorlogo.com/logos/gopher.svg" height="32" width="32"> | Employee microservice is also designed in Golang to manage employee's information. |
| [salary](./salary) | 8082 | Elasticsearch | <img src="https://www.vectorlogo.zone/logos/java/java-icon.svg" height="32" width="32"> | Salary is a Java based application which creates and manages employee's salary information. |

|**Application Name**|**Default Port**|**Dependency**|**Description**|
|--------------------|----------------|--------------|---------------|
| [elastic](./elastic) | 9200 | - | Elasticsearch is being used as non-structured database which manages the employee's information and salary. |
| [mysql](./mysql) | 3306 | - | MySQL is getting used for structured database which manages the employee's attendance information. |
